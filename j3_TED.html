          Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) is an auto immune diease caused by the activation of orbital fibroblasts by
          autoantibodies directed against thyroid receptors. It is an eye disorder that causes inflammation and damage
          to
          the tissue around the eye. In some individuals, the inflammation may involve the eye muscles, causing the eyes
          to
          become out of line, leading to double vision. In rare cases, TED can cause blindness from pressure on the
          nerve in
          the back of the eye or ulcers that form on the front of the eye (cornea). TED is primarily associated with an
          over-active thyroid gland due to Graves’ disease, although it can rarely occur in patients with an
          under-active or
          normally functioning thyroid gland. About a quarter of patients with Graves’ disease develop TED before,
          during or
          after the diagnosis of a thyroid disorder.
