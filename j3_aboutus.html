      <p>
        ComfortEyes is a website that was created by a group of students that learned about Thyroid Eye Disease and saw
        that
        only 19 in 100,000 people were diagnosed.
        As a group we learned about the difficulty TED imposes on a person's daily life.
        As humans we have experienced some obstacles and we seeked comfort, we began to think about rare diseases and
        how
        difficult it was to know someone to relate to.</p>
      <p>
        Our mission for ComforEyes is to connect Thyroid Eye Disease patients with one another and create a place of
        comfort
        for individuals with Thyroid Eye Disease. Our mission is to not only give TED patients an outlet where they can
        express their discomfort and talk to experts but to have an accessible place where they can inform themselves of
        other options whether that is new support groups or treatment options.
